# First Login Password Reset Implementation

## Overview
Implemented two key features:
1. **Welcome Email**: Automatically sent when a user is created with username and temporary password
2. **Force Password Reset**: Users must change their password on first login

## How It Works

### 1. User Creation Flow

When creating a new user:
1. **Generate Temporary Password**: 12-character random secure password
2. **Create User in Supabase Auth**: With the temporary password and `requires_password_change: true` flag
3. **Send Welcome Email**: Emailed with credentials (logged to console in development)
4. **User Record Created**: In the `users` table

### 2. First Login Flow

When a user logs in for the first time:
1. **Login with Temporary Password**: User logs in with email and temp password
2. **Check Flag**: System checks if `requires_password_change` is true
3. **Clear Flag**: Removes the flag from user metadata
4. **Redirect to Reset**: User is redirected to password reset page
5. **Set New Password**: User must set a permanent password
6. **Dashboard Access**: After password reset, user can access dashboard

### 3. Subsequent Logins

- User logs in with their permanent password
- No password reset required
- Direct access to dashboard

## Files Modified

### 1. `lib/email.ts` (New)
- Email utility function
- Formats welcome email with credentials
- Currently logs to console (easy to integrate with Resend/SendGrid)

### 2. `src/app/api/users/route.ts`
- Sends welcome email after user creation
- Adds `requires_password_change` flag to user metadata
- Handles errors gracefully

### 3. `src/app/login/page.tsx`
- Checks for password change requirement on login
- Redirects to password reset if needed
- Clears the flag after detecting first login

## Email Content

The welcome email includes:
- User's name
- Email address
- Temporary password
- Login URL
- Instructions for first login
- Security reminders

## Testing

### Create a User
1. Go to User Management tab
2. Create a new user
3. Check console logs for welcome email output

### First Login
1. Login with temporary password from console
2. User is redirected to password reset page
3. User sets new permanent password
4. User is redirected to dashboard

### Subsequent Logins
1. Login with permanent password
2. Direct access to dashboard (no reset required)

## Current Implementation (Development)

In development:
- Welcome email is **logged to console** with full details
- No actual email service configured
- Look for this in terminal:
  ```
  📧 WELCOME EMAIL
  TO: user@example.com
  Subject: Welcome to Digital Marketing Portal
  [Full email content with credentials]
  ```

## Production Setup

To send actual emails in production:

### Option 1: Resend (Recommended)

1. Install Resend:
   ```bash
   npm install resend
   ```

2. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```env
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```

3. Update `lib/email.ts` line 57:
   ```typescript
   const { Resend } = require('resend');
   const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);
   
   await resend.emails.send({
     from: 'noreply@yourdomain.com',
     to: email,
     subject: 'Welcome to Digital Marketing Portal',
     html: generateWelcomeEmailHTML(firstName, lastName, email, tempPassword),
   });
   ```

### Option 2: SendGrid

1. Install SendGrid:
   ```bash
   npm install @sendgrid/mail
   ```

2. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```env
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.xxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```

3. Update `lib/email.ts` similarly

## Security Features

1. **One-Time Use**: Temporary password works only once
2. **Forced Change**: Cannot access dashboard without setting permanent password
3. **Secure Generation**: Random 12-character passwords with special characters
4. **Secure Storage**: Passwords never stored in plain text

## User Experience

1. **Welcome Email** - Professional, branded email with all information
2. **Clear Instructions** - Step-by-step first login process
3. **Automatic Redirect** - No confusion, guided password setup
4. **Success Message** - Confirmation after password reset
