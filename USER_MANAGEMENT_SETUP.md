# User Management System - Setup Guide

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

The User Management system is now fully integrated into your Digital Marketing Portal. Here's how to get it running:

### **1. Current Status**
✅ **User Management Tab**: Added to dashboard navigation  
✅ **Mock Data Mode**: Works immediately without database setup  
✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for API failures  
✅ **Role-Based UI**: Adapts based on user permissions  

### **2. Testing the System**

#### **Access the Users Tab**
1. Navigate to your dashboard at `http://localhost:3001`
2. Click on the "Users" tab in the sidebar
3. You'll see the User Management interface with mock data

#### **Available Features (Mock Mode)**
- ✅ View user list with role-based filtering
- ✅ Create new users with role assignment
- ✅ Edit user information and status
- ✅ Delete users (with confirmation)
- ✅ Filter by role, status, and search
- ✅ View user statistics
- ✅ Role-based permission controls

### **3. Mock Data Included**

The system comes with sample users for testing:

| Role | Email | Name | Status |
|------|-------|------|--------|
| IT Admin | admin@example.com | IT Administrator | Active |
| Agency Admin | agency@example.com | Agency Admin | Active |
| Client | client@example.com | Client User | Active |

### **4. Role-Based Features**

#### **IT Admin (Current User)**
- ✅ Can view all users
- ✅ Can create new users
- ✅ Can edit any user
- ✅ Can delete users
- ✅ Can view activity logs
- ✅ Can assign roles

#### **Agency Admin (Mock User)**
- ✅ Can view assigned client users
- ✅ Can manage posts for clients
- ✅ Cannot create/delete users

#### **Client (Mock User)**
- ✅ Can view own profile
- ✅ Can edit own information
- ✅ Cannot access user management

### **5. Database Setup (Optional)**

To enable full API functionality:

#### **Step 1: Run Database Schema**
```sql
-- Execute the user_management_schema.sql file in your Supabase SQL Editor
-- This creates the users and activity_logs tables with RLS policies
```

#### **Step 2: Configure Authentication**
```typescript
// Update your Supabase configuration
// Ensure proper JWT token handling
// Set up user authentication flow
```

#### **Step 3: Test API Endpoints**
- `/api/users` - User management
- `/api/users/[id]` - Individual user operations
- `/api/users/activity-logs` - Audit logging

### **6. Production Deployment**

#### **Environment Variables**
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

#### **Security Considerations**
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) policies implemented
- ✅ Role-based access control at API level
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ Audit logging for all actions
- ✅ Secure password handling

### **7. Troubleshooting**

#### **Common Issues**

**Issue**: "Failed to load activity logs"
**Solution**: This is expected in mock mode. The system gracefully falls back to mock data.

**Issue**: API endpoints return 404
**Solution**: Ensure database schema is set up and Supabase is configured.

**Issue**: Permission errors
**Solution**: Check that the current user has IT_ADMIN role for full access.

#### **Debug Mode**
```typescript
// Check console for detailed logs
// All API failures are logged with fallback messages
// Mock data operations are clearly indicated
```

### **8. Next Steps**

#### **Immediate Actions**
1. ✅ Test the Users tab functionality
2. ✅ Try creating, editing, and deleting users
3. ✅ Test role-based filtering and permissions
4. ✅ Verify responsive design on different screen sizes
