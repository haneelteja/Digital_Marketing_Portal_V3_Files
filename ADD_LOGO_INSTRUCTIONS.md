# How to Add Your Logo - Step by Step Guide

## Current Status
❌ Logo file is **NOT** in the `public` folder. That's why you're seeing the "Logo Image Not Found" message.

## Quick Fix - 3 Steps:

### Step 1: Locate Your Logo PNG File
- Find your logo image file on your computer
- Make sure it's a PNG, SVG, JPG, or JPEG file
- The file should contain your complete logo (icon + "elma" text + "defines purity" tagline)

### Step 2: Copy the File
- Copy your logo file

### Step 3: Paste in Public Folder
1. Navigate to this folder in File Explorer:
   ```
   C:\Users\Haneel Teja\Cursor Applications\Digital Marketing Portal - V1\Digital_Marketing_Portal_Backup_2025-09-26_21-31-42\public
   ```

2. **Paste** your logo file there

3. **Rename** it to exactly: `elma-logo.png`
   - Right-click the file → Rename
   - Change the name to: `elma-logo.png`
   - Make sure there are no spaces or extra characters

### Step 4: Refresh Your Browser
- Go to: http://localhost:3000/login
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (hard refresh) or `F5`
- The logo should now appear!

## File Path Checklist:
✅ File location: `public/elma-logo.png`  
✅ Exact file name: `elma-logo.png` (lowercase, with hyphen)  
✅ File format: PNG, SVG, JPG, or JPEG  

## Troubleshooting:

**If you still don't see the logo:**
1. Make sure the file name is exactly `elma-logo.png` (not `elma-logo.PNG` or `Elma-Logo.png`)
2. Check that the file is in the `public` folder (not `src/public` or any other folder)
3. Restart your Next.js dev server:
   - Stop it: Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal
   - Start it again: `npm run dev`
4. Clear your browser cache: `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`

## Supported File Names:
The system will automatically try these names:
- `elma-logo.png` (primary)
- `elma-logo.svg`
- `elma-logo.jpg`
- `elma-logo.jpeg`
