## 🎯 **Validation Rules**

### **Duplicate Detection**
The system checks for:
- Same date
- Same post type
- Same client

If any combination already exists, it will be marked as a duplicate.

### **Date Format**
Your Excel dates should be in one of these formats:
- `Nov 1, 2025` ✅
- `2025-11-01` ✅
- `11/01/2025` ✅

### **Post Types**
Valid types:
- `Image`
- `Video`
- `Reel`
- `Story`

## 📊 **Expected Output**

After successful upload:
```
✅ 0 entries skipped - client not found
✅ 0 duplicate entries detected
✅ 7 valid entries ready to import
```

All 7 posts will appear on your calendar:
- Nov 1, 2025: 4 posts (one for each client)
- Nov 2, 2025: 2 posts
- Nov 3, 2025: 1 post

---

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### If clients still don't match:
1. Check spelling in Excel matches exactly with database
2. Check for extra spaces or special characters
3. Case doesn't matter (Benguluru = benguluru)

### If you see errors:
- Check browser console for details
- Verify clients are still in database (Configurations tab)
- Make sure dates are in a valid format
