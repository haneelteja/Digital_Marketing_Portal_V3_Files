# Supabase Auth Audit Log Analysis

## Password Recovery Requests Found

From the audit log, I found **4 password recovery requests**:

### 1. **nalluruhaneel@gmail.com**
- **Date**: October 7, 2025 at 11:47:50 UTC
- **Status**: `user_recovery_requested`
- **Entry ID**: `1410b02e-5444-437d-93aa-0934e7c3f369`

### 2. **amaravati1@violetww.com**
- **Date**: November 6, 2025 at 06:41:46 UTC
- **Status**: `user_recovery_requested`
- **Entry ID**: `1957bb05-e553-48d7-9d81-eebb10d4683a`
- **Most Recent**: This is the most recent recovery request in the log

### 3. **pega2023test@gmail.com** (First)
- **Date**: October 28, 2025 at 05:29:17 UTC
- **Status**: `user_recovery_requested`
- **Entry ID**: `2845f7b8-915a-479f-b40a-6402c2bcb463`

### 4. **pega2023test@gmail.com** (Second)
- **Date**: October 28, 2025 at 05:26:30 UTC
- **Status**: `user_recovery_requested`
- **Entry ID**: `49aa671d-bbde-42d5-8628-2b9936110609`

## Important Observations

### ✅ What the Log Shows
- All recovery requests show `"action":"user_recovery_requested"` - this means Supabase **received** the request
- The log entries are created when the request is made, not when the email is sent
- No error messages in the payload for these entries

### ⚠️ What the Log Doesn't Show
- **Email delivery status**: The log doesn't indicate if the email was actually sent
- **SMTP errors**: If there was an SMTP error, it might not appear in this audit log
- **Recent requests**: If you just tried password recovery, it might not appear yet (logs can take a few seconds to update)

## Checking Email Delivery

To verify if the email was actually sent, check:

1. **Supabase Auth Logs** (different from audit log):
   - Go to: **Supabase Dashboard** → **Authentication** → **Logs**
   - Look for entries around the time you requested password recovery
   - Check for SMTP errors or email sending confirmations

2. **Email Inbox**:
   - Check `pega2023test@gmail.com` inbox
   - Check spam/junk folder
   - Check Promotions tab (Gmail)

3. **Gmail SMTP Status**:
   - Since we just configured Gmail SMTP, the most recent recovery request might have been sent
   - The audit log shows the request was made, but doesn't confirm email delivery

## Next Steps

1. **Check Supabase Auth Logs** (not audit log) for SMTP/email errors
2. **Check your email inbox** for the password reset link
3. **Try password recovery again** now that Gmail SMTP is configured
4. **Monitor the audit log** for new `user_recovery_requested` entries

## Recent Activity

The most recent password recovery request in the audit log is:
- **User**: `amaravati1@violetww.com`
- **Date**: November 6, 2025 at 06:41:46 UTC
- **Status**: Request received by Supabase

If you just tried password recovery for `pega2023test@gmail.com` after configuring Gmail SMTP, the entry might not appear in the audit log yet (it can take a few seconds to appear).
