# Environment Setup Complete ✅

## ✅ What Was Done

1. **`.env.local` file updated** with your Supabase credentials:
   - ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` = https://hrzociojzzwktexhfnwb.supabase.co
   - ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` = sb_publishable_RQUG0zVXsFy_PuaKW7BMjg_T0HOGH42
   - ⚠️ `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` = Still needs to be added

2. **Development server restarted** to load new environment variables

---

## ⚠️ Important: Add Service Role Key

For full functionality (especially user management and admin operations), you need to add your **Service Role Key**:

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **Settings** → **API**
4. Find the **service_role** key (keep this secret!)
5. Update `.env.local`:
   ```env
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
   ```
6. Restart the server: `npm run dev`

## 📋 Next Steps

### 1. Set Up Database Schema

Run the database migration in Supabase SQL Editor:

1. Open `supabase_migration.sql` file
2. Copy the entire SQL script
3. Go to Supabase Dashboard → **SQL Editor**
4. Paste and click **Run**

This creates all required tables, indexes, and RLS policies.

### 2. Create Admin User

Option A: Using SQL (Recommended)
- Run `create_admin_user.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
- Update with your desired email and password

Option B: Using Supabase Dashboard
- Go to Authentication → Users
- Create a new user
- Then create a corresponding record in the `users` table with role `IT_ADMIN`

### 3. Test the Application

1. Visit: **http://localhost:3000**
2. Login with your admin credentials
3. Test features:
   - Create a client
   - Add calendar entries
   - Upload files
   - Manage users (IT_ADMIN only)

## 🔍 Verify Setup

### Check Health Endpoint
Visit: http://localhost:3000/api/health

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "database": "connected"
}
```

If you see "Database connection failed", verify:
- Database migration script has been run
- Supabase project is active
- Credentials are correct

## 📚 Current Status

- ✅ Environment variables configured
- ✅ Development server running
- ⚠️ Service role key needed (for admin operations)
- ⚠️ Database migration needed (run `supabase_migration.sql`)
- ⚠️ Admin user needed (create via SQL or dashboard)

---

## 🎯 Application URL

**Main Application:** http://localhost:3000

The application should now be accessible with your Supabase credentials!

---

**Note:** Some features (like user management) require the service role key. Client-side features (calendar, posts) will work with just the anon key.
