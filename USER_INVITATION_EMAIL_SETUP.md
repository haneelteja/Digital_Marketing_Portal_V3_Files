# User Invitation Email Setup

## Summary
The auth callback page has been created to handle email invitations.

## Current Status
✅ **Callback page created** at `/src/app/auth/callback/page.tsx`
✅ **Email invitations are working** (see terminal line 208: "Invitation email sent successfully to: pega2023test@gmail.com")

## How Email Invitations Work

### The Email Flow
1. When you create a user, an invitation email is sent to their email address
2. The email contains a magic link with a secure token
3. When the user clicks the link, they are redirected to `/auth/callback`
4. The callback page:
   - Extracts the access token from the URL
   - Sets up their Supabase session
   - Redirects them to the dashboard

### Why "Password is not given in email"
The email invitation uses Supabase's **magic link authentication**:
- No password is sent in the email (this is secure)
- The magic link contains a secure token that allows them to set their password
- When they click the link, they'll be prompted to create their password
- After setting their password, they can log in normally

### Testing the Invitation
1. Check the email for `pega2023test@gmail.com`
2. Click the invitation link in the email
3. It should redirect to `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
4. They'll be prompted to set their password
5. After setting password, they'll be redirected to the dashboard

## Important Notes

⚠️ **For Production:**
- Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` in `.env.local` to your production domain
- Configure SMTP settings in Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > Email Templates
- Test the email invitation flow thoroughly

## Troubleshooting

### 404 Error on /auth/callback
- ✅ **Fixed**: Created the callback page at `src/app/auth/callback/page.tsx`

### User cannot set password
- Make sure the invitation email was sent successfully
- Check Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > Users for the user
- Verify the user's email is correct
- Check Supabase logs for any errors

### Magic Link Expired
- Magic links expire after a certain time (default: 1 hour)
- User will need to request a new invitation
- You can resend the invitation by creating a new user or using Supabase Dashboard

## Next Steps
1. The callback page should now handle invitation links
2. Users can click the link in the email to complete setup
3. They'll be able to set their password and access the dashboard
